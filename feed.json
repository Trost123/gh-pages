            "content_html": "<p>Inspired by mobile game <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herocraft.democracy&amp;hl=ru\" title=\"Democracy on Google Play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Democracy</a> (which, in turn was inspired by <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.tripletown&amp;hl=en\" title=\"Tripple Town on Google Play\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tripple Town</a>), I wanted to make a zombie-apocalypse themed game with same mechanics. Mostly because I felt like programming unique unit behaviours would be fun. I shared this idea with a friend and he agreed to take care of graphics and testing.</p>\n<p>The first rule of this game is: place 3 (or more) similar units in adjacent tiles and they will be combined into a new one.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2tRkxSn3x4rxsx4QYE/giphy.gif\">\n<figcaption >Just seeing this animation makes me feel good</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So, 3 food units = backpack. And what if we do this process 3 times to combine 3 backpacks?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1gdnAOsZtmFqNzxUcA/giphy.gif\" width=\"333\" height=\"253\">\n<figcaption >We get a scavenger\\survivor</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>How about doing these two combinations in one turn?</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/236NVEYajXWDw8EVcs/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"194\"></p>\n<p>Every unit had an information card describing it's abilities:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://trost123.github.io/media/posts/10/Td8ftCl.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"440\"> <img src=\"https://trost123.github.io/media/posts/10/Mk5FyPi.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"440\"></p>\n<p>For example, as you play the game - crawling zombies would move around the field every 4 turns (notice the filling outline):</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/w5Rt72exnnAgBYJgn3/giphy.gif\" width=\"287\" height=\"289\"></p>\n<p>And so they could combine themselves:</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/cYMec0vARQ53YjCXmJ/giphy.gif\" width=\"289\" height=\"289\"></p>\n<p>You could build a big Tank unit that would kill zombies around it:</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/muYvn2K9WVpmEvmPbI/giphy.gif\" width=\"287\" height=\"289\"></p>\n<p>In total there are 16 unique units, each with their special behaviors: 5 yellow (survivors), 4 blue (defenders), 5 red (zombies). Most of them were created by combining. The gameplay looked something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/RkMZAANaehw5yvOmh7/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>You could use the helicopter to move a unit from one tile to another, you had a storage slot if you wanted to save some unit for later use, you had dynamite to blow up zombies and get money for that.</p>\n<p>The game also featured 10 missions, completing which awarded you extra money, which you could spend in shop:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ksKv91IhMEtBHIX4GB/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>Each unit affected the chaos\\order ballance (red\\blue vertical bar), which made you profit more\\less from all sources. The goal of the game was to get 100% vaccine development (for a zombe virus). You could do so by building a Curemobiles (level 6 yellow unit), which generated a small % every few turs and by boosting development by 5% for $5000 in shop. </p>\n<p>You lose if you don't have any legit moves. Gameover check required me to check 4 different conditions (is the field filled? can the player use dynamite\\helicopter? can he buy one in shop? is his storage slot empty?).</p>\n<p>Programming and testing this from ground-up was fun. A lot of testing, a lot of funny bugs and a feeling of acomplishment when everything worked.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">In fact, I opened the game to make a few screenshots for this text and spent an hour playing because it's quite addictive.</span></p>\n<p>Now we get to the sad part: there wasn't a lot of people who figured out how to play this game, becasue we were too lazy to develop a proper tutorial.<br>There were too many things to explain and our tutorial ended up being too long and overloaded with text.</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to read a 4-page rulebook before playing a flash game.</p>\n<p>You could try though. <a href=\"http://www.gameland.com/games/horror-games/681/the-triple-threat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Play The Triple Thread online here</a>.</p>",

Together with an artist we created this prototype:<br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cQ2y7Mt.png\"><br>It was going to be a game about your immune system defending against evil bacteria. You control the blue little guy with WASD + LMB to shoot your gun, also you have 4 turrets, that fire slow AoE missles when you press space. I coded the destructible ground and it was a fun challenge, but it didn't go any futher, because both of us had lacked free time and vision on how to wrap this into a full game.<br>You can <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/ZDsHsLM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play No More Rockets here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Chebureki</strong><br>A joke game about Oleh Blokhin. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aoDt-99B-o\"></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aoDt-99B-o\" title=\"Youtube video\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Somebody threw a belyash at him</a> once, so my friend offered to make a short joke game about it.<br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QtCG0cj.png\">I used it as an opportunity to learn Box2D - a physics engine for Flash.<br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OYheXSo.gif\"><br>This allowed me to make a complex hitbox for chebureki (half-circle) and outline of our character, which resulted in opportunity to of hilarious stacking:<br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y5kBAul.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"336\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4MqCMYd.png\"><br>You can <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/mWut3PY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play Chebureki here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>WarTD</strong><br>A dropped attempt to develop a World War themed tower defence game.<br>The artist provided gread-looking renders of 3d map, turrets, enemies and explosion aimations, it could be a great game, but we ran out of motivation fast. I enjoyed the challenge of using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Object-oriented programming\">OOP</a> to program enemy logic, so that we could place waypoints in a visual editor and enemies would turn left\\right when they step on it.<br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Xp4hLdP.png\"><br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RSeLe1X.png\"><br>You can <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/yowP-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play WarTD here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Crane Master</strong><br>Another experiment with Box2d, kind of inspired by those Crane Machines where you could win toys.<br>Notice how the guy in the crane is moving his hands when you move the crane, the sawmill animation in the background and the rope physics.<br>Once again - fun mechanic to develop and mess around with, but didn't find a way to make a full game out of it.<br><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/w79FWaXVnBsnfBvQsZ/giphy.gif\"><br>You can <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/hp6k_kI\"></a><a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/hp6k_kI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play Crane Master here</a>. Controls are WASD+Space.</li>\n<li><strong>ILoveMyBox</strong><br>Yet another effort to create a physics-based game. This was planned to be a platformer about a cat who loves boxes. (Box design inspired by Companion Cube from Portal ♡)<br><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/BWuQuYFxmJ2EpwjfIV/giphy.gif\"><br>You can play <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/UBk7seU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ILoveMyBox here</a>. Left click to spawn\\drag boxes. WASD to move. Warning: jumping doesn't work.</li>\n<li><strong>Conveyour Survival<br></strong>Yet another try to game a game based on physics. The idea was that you're on a conveyour and need to survive as long as possible. I didn't work long before dropping this one, as you can see.<br><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/8mqy3jz3Zm4CRffaJp/giphy.gif\"><br>You can <a href=\"http://www.fastswf.com/Yb7qe38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">play Conveyour Survival here</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While we're on the topic of 2d physics-based games: I'd like to recommend <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/674940/Stick_Fight_The_Game/\"></a><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/674940/Stick_Fight_The_Game/\" title=\"Stick Fight: The Game on Steam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"Stick Fight: The Game\"</a>.

One of those videos got 7 million views:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AL0MGdDcaQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Later we started to notice reskinned versions of our game on the web and android versions on Google Play Store:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image undefined\" ><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vu0NbU4.png\">\n<figcaption >Reskinned clones of our game in Google Play</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image undefined\" ><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tpUoVA5.png\">\n<figcaption >Letsplays of our game and clones of our game</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We contacted Google to take those down. Eventually they did take down some of those, but new ones kept popping up and we gave up.
