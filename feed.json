I used Adobe Flash (which uses ActionScript3 as a scripting language). I used <a href=\"http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/as3-avoider-game-tutorial-base/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this amazing tutorial</a> to learn how to create a basic shooter game in Flash, and then just remixed it a little.</p>\n<p>In this game you can find references to my favourite games of the time: Team Fortress 2, C&amp;C, Wormix.</p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.kongregate.com/games/trost123/braindef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Play BrainDef on Kongregate\">play BrainDef on Kongregate</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lgfecFT.png\" alt=\"BrainDef screenshot\" width=\"722\" height=\"502\"></p>",

I always wanted to become an animator - and this job was basically about animating adverisement banners in Adobe Flash.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of those banners.

I found out that you can also do interactive stuff in flash, so I dived into simple scripting and created this: a plate-clock that shows real time, with a silly secret that you could find if you drag a knife or a fork with your mouse!<object id=\"viewattachswf_ed69d4f773657ec284ec32a98414e3f8\" style=\"visibility: visible;\" data=\"https://st.fl.ru/users/bi/billcosby/upload/f_4e78f787902ea.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"never\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"\" /></object></p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots for those, who can't use flash in their browser:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UXurmVH.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gofl8L8.png\"> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WfZIXiQ.png\"> <img src=\"https://trost123.github.io/media/posts/3/d7jvduqi.bmp\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"195\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HC9wrCV.png\"></p>\n<p>This was an incredible experience and helped me learn basics of animation and scripting, which I later used to <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/2\">develop flash games</a>.</p>",
