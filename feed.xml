                <p class="msg msg--highlight ">Today I'm going to tell you how I quickly made this website using <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Publii, a new Static CMS with GUI to build an extremely safe, fast and stylish HTML website.">Publii</a> and hosted it for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository.

<p>My goal was to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quickly</span> develop and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">host</span> a simple, yet good-looking portfolio\blog site <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for free</span>. After some research I found <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Publii, a new Static CMS with GUI to build an extremely safe, fast and stylish HTML website.">Publii</a> - a no-database CMS, that allows to easily upload to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Websites for you and your projects, hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a> for a free hosting. And it features a nice set of <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/products/category/freebies/" title="Free Publii themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free themes</a>!</p>
<p>Publii is a free desktop app that allows you to edit and manage your site's content using intuitive user interface. No html\css knowledge required.</p>

<p>(Although, I do know how build sites from scratch, I think using a ready solution is smarter than hand-crafting your site from scratch.)</p>
<p>That's it. I could go more in-depth about setting it up, but there are already <a href="https://getpublii.com/docs/host-static-website-github-pages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="How to create a static website using Github Pages">plenty of guides on it</a>.</p>

                <p>After good reception of <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/6">MonsterCraft</a> it was obvious that we should release a sequel. Turns out, making a good sequel is not as easy as it seems - we had to add new stuff without overcomplicating things.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things we decided to do in the sequel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added in a third race - demons. Demons can't be crafted, but player can capture and use them later in the game.</li>
<li>Added an ability to buy armor for your units. So now each unit has 3 tiers: no armor, light armor, heavy armor.</li>
<li>Added spells - a way for a player to take part in fights.</li>
<li>Made a game longer by adding more worlds\levels.</li>
<li>Added a boss in the end of each world. Final boss also tricky and required smart use of spells to win.</li>
<li>Added achievements.</li>
</ul>

                <p>This one took a while to finish. Still working with the same team I made <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/4">Cortex Fortress</a> and <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/6">MonsterCraft</a> with, we decided to make something more complex: a top-down shooter with a lot of levels, enemy types, weapons, perks, bosses etc.</p>
<p>Our 3d artist rendered 3d models and effects into images so we could simulate 3d in flash. It looked great, but had me struggle a lot with performance: it was the first time I had to spend a lot of time optimizing the game. And I loved that challenge. For example, I had to find a way to draw blood into the ground texture, so it doesn't take extra memory and the game runs smooth.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots:</p>

<p>Sadly, the game didn't get released by a publisher for some reason. Also, because we sold an exclusive license for this game, I can't publish it anywhere, but you can check out the trailer:</p>

                <p>So I was hanging out with my best friend and were brainstoring game ideas. We weren't planning to develop one together - we just enjoyed discussing interesting game ideas.</p>
<p>That day we came up with the idea of <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/15629/monstercraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Play MonsterCraft on ArmorGames">MonsterCraft</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a basic combination logic: A+B=C and use it to craft units. Make the result logical: robot+robot = bigger robot, zombie+zombie = big zombie, robot+zombie = cyborg zombie!
<figure class="post__image undefined" ><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nKf4YWr.png" alt="Craftbook" width="668" height="464">
<figcaption >So we came up with a 11-unit roster.</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I described the idea to the team I made <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/4">Cortex Fortress</a> with and we developed the game fairly quickly.</p>
<p>It was quite successful: we got a lot of good reviews and people started making walthroughs and letsplays of MonsterCraft on youtube. One of those videos got 7 million views:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_AL0MGdDcaQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Later we started to notice reskinned versions of our game on the web and android versions on Google Play Store:</p>
<figure class="post__image undefined" ><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vu0NbU4.png">
<figcaption >Reskinned clones of our game in Google Play</figcaption>

<figure class="post__image undefined" ><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tpUoVA5.png">
<figcaption >Letsplays of our game and clones of our game</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We contacted Google to take those down. Eventually they did take down some of those, but new ones kept popping up and we gave up. I'd say proudly I accepted this as a sign of success and popularity.</p>

                <p>After releasing my first game - <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/2">BrainDef</a>, I got my first fan!</p>
<p>It was not just an ordinary fan, it was a guy, experienced in making 2d and 3d art for games. He offered to join me and make another game for a 50\50 profits split when it goes live. I was so hyped back then! Later on he also invited his friend into our little team, who took care of SFX and music.</p>
<p>Those people helped me gain confidence and motivation to release my games faster and brought the quality level of my games way up.</p>

                <p>Back in 2012, after reading a lot of success stories on <a href="http://flashgamedev.ru/">flashgamedev.ru</a> I decided to try creating a game myself.</p>
<p>This was my first experience of programming. I used Adobe Flash (which uses ActionScript3 as a scripting language). I used <a href="http://gamedev.michaeljameswilliams.com/as3-avoider-game-tutorial-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this amazing tutorial</a> to learn how to create a basic shooter game in Flash, and then just remixed it a little.</p>
<p>In this game you can find references to my favourite games of the time: Team Fortress 2, C&amp;C, Wormix.</p>

                <p>On my first year of university I started earning some pocket money as a freelancer. It wasn't much, but it was fun. I always wanted to become an animator - and this job was basically about animating adverisement banners in Adobe Flash.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of those banners. For more you can <a href="https://www.fl.ru/users/billcosby/portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look into my fl.ru profile</a>.</p>
<p><object id="viewattachswf_d38e6192e875efd80b6bb3cbd2330d4f" style="visibility: visible;" data="https://st.fl.ru/users/bi/billcosby/upload/f_4e8dec3962052.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="188" height="257"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never" /><param name="wmode" value="" /></object> <object id="viewattachswf_dc25ad4f25238c4c3715ca19a2c9666f" style="visibility: visible;" data="https://st.fl.ru/users/bi/billcosby/upload/f_4ec03fdcad9eb.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="468" height="90"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never" /><param name="wmode" value="" /></object></p>
<p>The more I used Adobe Flash, the more creative I started getting. I found out that you can also do interactive stuff in flash, so I dived into simple scripting and created this: a plate-clock that shows real time, with a silly secret that you could find if you drag a knife or a fork with your mouse!<object id="viewattachswf_ed69d4f773657ec284ec32a98414e3f8" style="visibility: visible;" data="https://st.fl.ru/users/bi/billcosby/upload/f_4e78f787902ea.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="500"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never" /><param name="wmode" value="" /></object></p>
<p>Here are some screenshots for those, who can't use flash in their browser:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HC9wrCV.png"></p>
<p>This was an incredible experience and helped me learn basics of animation and scripting, which I later used to <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/2">develop flash games</a>.</p>
